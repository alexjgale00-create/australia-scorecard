# The Australia Scorecard

See `README.md` (how to run this) and `METHODOLOGY.md` (full scoring
write-up) for detail. This file records durable project decisions that
should survive across sessions.

## Scoring

- **Direction is peer-relative, everywhere on the site** (gauge cards, dot
  strips, What's Moving, the composite's improving/flat/deteriorating
  counts). It classifies the trend in Australia's *level score* (position
  within the 9-country peer set: `directionThresholdScorePointsPerYear` in
  `gauges.config.json`, currently 0.5 pts/year) — **not** the trend in the
  raw published number.
- Australia's raw-value trend (is the number itself going up or down:
  `directionThresholdPctPerYear`, currently 0.3%/year) is still computed,
  but is only ever shown in the "Two ways to read this" block on each gauge
  detail page — never used for the primary direction arrows. The two can
  genuinely disagree (a raw number can rise while the country still loses
  ground to faster-improving peers), and showing only one risked implying
  they always move together.
- Decided 2026, design-overhaul phase, after the raw-value-only direction
  arrow on a gauge card read as contradictory next to a declining
  peer-relative sparkline on the same card.
- Score bands (Falling Behind/Slipping/Holding/Strengthening/Leading,
  thresholds 24/44/59/79 in `gauges.config.json`) are explicitly placeholder
  — flagged with `_scoreBandsTodo` in the config — and must be recalibrated
  against real data at the Phase D checkpoint, before any public release.
